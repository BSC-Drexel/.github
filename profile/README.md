# About the BSC

Welcome to the Biostatistics Scientific Collaboration Center (BSC)! The BSC is based in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Dornsife School of Public Health.

If you are looking for team members who can contribute data management best practices, participate in study design, and provide statistical collaboration, then you have come to the right place.â€¯

The BSC is a fee for service center, and we are here to collaborate with you every step of the way.

We appreciate the opportunity to join as you begin to plan your study by engaging in conversations about refining study design and aims with a biostatistics and data management lens. We can bring our experience to:

 * Perform power and sample size calculations based on preliminary data already summarized/analyzed.
 * Use preliminary data to perform analyses to strengthen prior research and scientific rigor for the significance and approach sections of the grant.
 * Provide you with best practices and guidance as you build and maintain your database, or you can leave it to us for all database needs.
 * Review grant applications and other proposals with emphasis on rigor and reproducibility.
 * Are you utilizing data already collected? No problem, the BSC can be the group that performs the quantitative analyses for your project.

BSC is task based and together, we create and implement a Scope of Work (SOW) for a set of clearly defined deliverables for each stage of the data management and analysis process. Please see below for examples of BSC deliverables.
